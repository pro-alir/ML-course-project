# ML-course-project

This project is part of the **Introduction to Machine Learning** course under Dr. Fatemeh Mirsalehi and TA Amirhossein Razlighi. It consists of two main parts:

1. **CNN from Scratch:**  
   In this section, I implemented a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch to gain a deeper understanding of how convolutional layers work. I manually coded the forward and backward pass, including the calculation of gradients. Additionally, I applied different convolutional kernels like Sobel, Grayscale, and Gaussian Blur to visualize their effects on sample images.

2. **Neural Style Transfer:**  
   For this part, I used a pre-trained VGG19 model to implement Neural Style Transfer, where the style of one image is applied to the content of another. I calculated content and style losses, then optimized the image using the LBFGS optimizer. The process included visualizing the transformation and plotting the loss curves.

The project uses Python with libraries such as PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pillow. It showcases essential techniques in computer vision, from CNN implementation to advanced style transfer methods.
